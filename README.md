A pizza order web app -Asp.Net Core 3.1 MVC / EF Core - Code First Migration 
====================================================================================

Though I don't recommend anyone to invest in Monolith app any more. However, if you have to build one from scratch or upgrade a legacy .Net 4.x MVC app or a WebForm project to ASP.NET Core MVC this project will give you a guideline how to do it correctly. 

#Technology Stack used in this project:
======================================

- ASP.NET Core 3.1 
- MVC Core 
- Entity Framework Core - Code First Migration approach
- ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection

- XUnit for Unit Testing
